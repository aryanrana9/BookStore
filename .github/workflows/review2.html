                        <li><b>Raman: </b><br/>This book creates a new world where dragons reign supreme and humans are rated by numbers- until the young hero is rated a 0, the lowest of the low. It follows him as he escapes the binds of his old life and creates a new one- meeting new people, and having old pals catch up with him to help him on his adventure.</li>
                        <li><b>Ravi: </b> <br/>I loved this book so much. It was fun and suspenseful. I would recommend this book for you and anyone who likes fantasy.</li>

                <li><b>Bhavik:</b><br>I'm a little late to the party in reading this book but let me tell you it did not disappoint. I literally could not put it down and finished it in less than a week. A couple of good side twists as well. Great Read!</li>
                <li><b>Bhrat:</b><br>Easy to read and well written. Complex topics written in an easy to read and exciting way. I'm not a fast reader and I blew through this book.</li>

        <li>REVIEWS: <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Piyush:</b><br>It’s clear why this is a classic. It’s beautifully written, the vivid descriptions spring easily to mind, and it very much invites the reader into America of the 1920s. The characters are fascinating and firmly rooted in the roles they play in the unfolding of the story.</li>
                <li><b>Bharat:</b>It was a golden era for some, the 1920s. And for a privileged few who enjoyed the lavish parties thrown by Jay Gatsby, it was a time of decadence, vibrancy, and texture.</li>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Satvik:</b><br>The book seems somewhat incomplete. What about Sia's romance with Gyan. The only closure and completeness is in the story of Biju and his penny less return from America.</li>
                <li><b>Shreya:</b><br>A great book. One must read it once in their life. A true reality of indian society behind kalimpong situation of Nepalis movement.The opening and ending is awesome of this book though middle is a bit bored but all in all it is an amazing book...</li>

        <li>REVIEWS: <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Aryan:</b><br>It’s the story about the animals, Mowgli and the rules of the jungle.
                    This is the first part of the Jungle Book and I absolutely enjoyed reading it.               
                    The content is conveniently divided into short chapters which can be read as a short story each with some chapters as a whole poetry each.</li>
                <li><b>Abhay:</b><br>What do you say about a classic. Kipling wrote many books about India during the Raj period. They are filled with stories of the period and the people, rich and poor, Anglo and Indian.</li>

                <li><b>Harshita:</b><br>This book gives a brief description of the exploitation and racial discrimination of Indians by the British government during the colonial period. The writer rightly reflected the mindset of Indian people and religion cast based discrimination too.</li>
                <li><b>Suhani:</b><br>EM Forster writes beauty, love, thought, doubt, sadness, friendship, wisdom... He writes them, with words he makes them, he writes humanity itself, he is like a writing god...</li>

                <li><b>Ram:</b><br>I found this allegorical novel so compelling, so delightful, so well written, and such a paradoxical mix of sacred-profane and earnest-lighthearted that I was blown away. In my view, it deserves a ten-star rating.</li>
                <li><b>Lakshman:</b><br>This is a thrilling adventure story that has made me laugh and weep. In this review I plan to talk about the wonderful, exciting story in its entirety.</li>

                <li><b>Anubhav:</b><br>I really enjoy the experience of this book. I was curious about it because of the Netflix series. It has great female characters, my two favorites are Mrs Mahesh Kapoor and Menakshi. I am waiting "Suitable Girl" with joy in my heart.</li>
                <li><b>Ansh:</b><br>As Vikram Seth's Magnum Opus A Suitable Boy approached its 20th year, since first being published by Faber & Faber, the public's affection for this epical work still remains as strong as it ever did.</li>
